# Marketplace with Ecsrow smart contract
Project goal is to create safe platform for online shopping. The main part of the project is smart contract written in contract-oriented language Solidity.

For example our team has created site for online purchasing Apple iPhones. 

Back-end - Django framework with SQLite database.


## Theoretical functionality:
1. Ð¡heck the availability of goods - if available, transfer money to smart contract.
2. Loyalty program - discounts/bonuses applies automatically.
3. Product reservation at the moment of money transfer to smart contract. 
4. Timeout - if order has not been processed for example in a day - money should
be refund and order cancel.
5. Money transfer to seller only when product has been delivered.
6. Seller has an ability to cancel order, money must be return back to customer.
